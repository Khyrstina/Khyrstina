## About Me

👋 Welcome fellow digital wanderer, my name is Khyrstina! By day, I'm an Computer Science student, and by night, I'm well... usually studying for the "by day" part 😅. 

🌐 My coding journey is currently focused on web development – but you might see some C# from time to time in older projects, and some new languages in the future as I complete my degree. Currently, I'm on a quest to build 🏔️**Parklopedia**🏔️, a solo project that's all about getting people the information they need to start exploring national parks. I'm having so much fun building this project that it has grown to be much more than I originally planned! I'm also working on **VueFromMars**, a project dedicated to the work that NASA has done in the Mars Exploration Program! 

🌌 When I don't have my eyes glued to a textbook or my screen (I'm concerned my eye doctor will find VScode seared into my retinas) you can find me playing with arduino, following 🪐 NASA news, or taking a hike (literally). 

Is it fun fact time? 😊 When I was really young I wanted to grow up to be a "Paleontologist" only to find out that the job description *wasn't* essentially a veterinarian for dinosaurs. Nevertheless, my favorite is still the Utahraptor 🦖 and I'm *kinda* glad I don't have to try to trick one into eating a heartworm pill every month.

🦕 So, if you have suggestions/comments, want to plot the return of the T-rex(we should probably keep that part a secret), or just want to chat you can email me [here](rmjvdksny@mozmail.com) and maybe we can set up a chat on Discord! Anyways, thanks for reading!
